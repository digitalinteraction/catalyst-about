# Not-Equal Catalyst

Catalyst is a part of [Not-Equal](https://not-equal.tech) which is a UKRI funded network, NetworkPlus, that aims to foster new collaborations in order to create the conditions for digital technology to support social justice, and develop a path for inclusive digital innovation and a fairer future for all in and through the digital economy.

Catalyst is a space to browse, search and view Expressions Of Interests (EOIs) to encourage engagment and collaberations between network members. The system was designed and developed using Unplatformed Design to repurpose existing technologies rather than making new platforms.

## What is Unplatformed Design?

Unplatformed Design is the idea of building new technologies ontop of existing platforms, rather than designing, creating and deploying brand new platforms. In this case we repurposed [Trello](https://trello.com) as our CMS and database, then making the site creates a read-only view on the cards stored in trello.

## Who made this?

This project was developed at [Open Lab](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk) which is a cross-disiplinary research group at Newcastle University, UK.
